# Jupiter

Very much a work in progress...

Jupiter is a collection of software for my skycam project. It will run on a Raspberry Pi and upload photo/video to
DigitalOcean via their blob storage solution, Spaces.

## Moneta
Moneta is the name of the DigitalOcean Spaces bucket and it will hold all photos taken by the skycam as well as any
timelapse videos created.

## Astraios
Camera package for telling the RPi to take photos.

## Minerva
A database (also on DigitalOcean) to store photo/timelapse metadata.

## Saturn
Timelapse creation tool
